## SpacePlusU UTSG - Deleting Your Account
This page contains instructions for deleting your SpacePlusU UTSG account, as well as information regarding how we handle your information after account deletion.

### Instructions
There are two methods of deleting your SpacePlusU UTSG account.  Either using the button in the app, or via a manual request.  Both methods will be explained below.

#### Account Deletion via the SpacePlusU UTSG App
In order to delete your account using the SpacePlusU UTSG App, follow these steps:
1. Ensure your app version is at least the minimum version with account deletion functionality (Android:`UTSG-v3.1.0` , iOS:`<TBD>`)
2. Ensure you are signed in on the account you wish to delete
3. Navigate to the "Me" page
4. Tap the "Delete account" button at the bottom of the page
5. Complete the "Delete account" flow


#### Account Deletion via a Manual Email Request
If you do not have access to the app, a manual account deletion request can be sent.  To initiate a manual account deletion request, please follow these steps:
1. Send an email from the email address associated with the account to `admin@spaceplusu.ca` with the subject `SpacePlusU UTSG Account Deletion Request`
2. We will email you back to confirm the deletion request
3. Once we receive final confirmation from you, we will perform the account deletion manually.  After account deletion is complete, we will send you a confirmation via email


### Information Handling
Upon deleting your account, we also immediately delete any and all stored information we have related to your account.

Due to the above, please note that account deletions are permanent and irreversible.  A deleted account cannot be recovered, however a new account can still be created with the same email addresss.
